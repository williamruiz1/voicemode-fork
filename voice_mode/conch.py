"""Conch - Simple lock file for voice conversation coordination.

The Conch provides a lock file mechanism to indicate when a voice conversation
is active. This allows other processes (like sound effect hooks) to check
whether to suppress their audio output.

Lock file location: ~/.voicemode/conch

Usage:
    # As context manager (recommended)
    with Conch(agent_name="cora"):
        # ... voice conversation logic ...

    # Manual acquire/release
    conch = Conch()
    conch.acquire(agent_name="cora")
    try:
        # ... voice conversation logic ...
    finally:
        conch.release()

    # Check if converse is active (for external scripts)
    if Conch.is_active():
        print("Someone is in a voice conversation")
